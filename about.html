## Hello! I'm Austyn Park.

<p>
This is a blog to write down my projects and studies. I don't write blogs for anyone, but just
record what I do or what I think.
</p> <p>
I am a self-motivated and largely self-taught professional who likes to
work hard but efficiently.
</p><p>
When I am not at the keyboard, you will likely find me watching movies or listening music with a good book.
</p><p>
If you are interested in knowing more, read my posts or take a look
at my pictures.</p>
